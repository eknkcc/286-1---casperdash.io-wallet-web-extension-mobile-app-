# Coding Standards

## General Observations

Code is generally well-structured and readable. The Github linked project is easy and successful to install, but an error was encountered during the installation phase of the app project. An error was received in the unit tests of the project. Manual tests fail for making a delegation using the casper signer. These errors prevent the project from succeeding.

# Final Conclusion
The project provides the most of the functionalities described in the grant application and milestone acceptance criteria. 
The reviewer praises the OP for the general stability and the fluid user experience of the app.
However, it is recommended to fix test errors in the lib file. Also the "delegate using casper signer" in the milestone doesn't work properly. 
Thus, in the reviewer's opinion, this submission should fail.
